Public Speaking Assistant built for VR

Runs in oculus and open xr,

Here is the state of VerboseVR as it stands.

Maps, interactivity, and models have been introduced, along with rudimentary wit.ai capable of understanding speech but not quite
at the level of full comprehension. I am exicted to use these new technologies, as this one taste has created waves 
of passion and inguenity I did not seem to have before. Specifically, I see this as a social, educationally, and mental safe place
where those who are willing to share are highlighted and given the platform through eventually debate rooms, compeitions, and eventual 
community support

A passion project of a long time, I am just now able to create the impact that my role models had on me. 
By democratizing education of soft-skills, I am certain that we will change generations for years to come in how
they become and eventually foster the next of kin. For me, I found immense help in some of the strategies I have tried 
implement in this app, and hope that even one child or adult will appreciate and use this to it's fullest potential
